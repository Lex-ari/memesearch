# memesearch
## An android utility to upload and save pictures to a backend server, and search them up with your own user-created tags!

CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE, BACKENDLESS TRIAL EXPIRED.

Project done in mid-2021 for Mr. Shorr's Android Development class at the South Pasadena High School.

I had a lot of "memes" and funny pictures saved on my phone, but it takes a lot of storage and it takes too much time to "dig" through and find the one "meme" I'm looking for. Also, searching the internet for the "meme" is difficult, since I sometimes remember small details that doesn't exactly describe the whole meme.

Features:
- User log-in screen with username and password.
  - Functional user creation screen for username, password, repeat password, email, etc.
- 3xinf display of saved "memes" or photos, similar to tiktok or instagram.
- Search bar used to search for tags created by the user.
- Ability to upload pictures and set own tags and save.
- Photos do not save to the phone! They save to backendless, meaning more storage space on phone!
